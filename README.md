Implemented membership system into business model

In this project, I addressed the need for understanding and influencing customer spending behaviors by designing and implementing a data management system. 
I created SQL tables for detailed transaction data and summary information, transformed the data to categorize customers into membership types based on their spending, 
and developed functions, triggers, and stored procedures to automate data updates and report generation. 
This comprehensive solution aims to provide valuable insights into customer behavior and drive business growth through a new membership system.
